# Robotics Hand Control Through Computer Vision

This project goal is to create a controlled robotics hand that responds to hand movements. Utilizing an Arduino Uno as the microcontroller, the system translates real-time hand gestures into commands for the robotic hand. I used computer vision technologies, such as mediapipe and opencv to enhances the recognition and interpretation of hand movements.
